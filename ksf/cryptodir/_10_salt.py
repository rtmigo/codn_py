"""The file storing the salt value is located in the same directory as the rest
of the files. It has the same incomprehensible base64 name of the same length.

The main thing that distinguishes it: the file size is less than a kilobyte
(up to 1023 bytes).

The salt is not secret - and anyone who has studied the principle of the
program will be able to read the salt from the directory.

Filename tricks make the origin of the data obscure. We will just have a
directory with "random" data with "random" 48-byte names, and in which there
is only one file less than a kilobyte.

It can be hypothesized that this directory was created by this program, but
without having at least one password, it is impossible to prove.
