    """A fileset is a set of files related to the same item. One of these
    files contains encrypted item data, others are fake or contain outdated
    data.

    The item name is a secret: knowing the name, we can not only find the
    corresponding files, but also decrypt the data.

    The private key is derived from the item name. Computing a private key
    from a name is the most resource-intensive task. We try to do this at
    most once. After that, instead of a name, we always use only the key.

    ----

    The salt here is a constant common to all instances of the application.
    This makes the password sufficient to obtain the private key on any
    computer.

    In theory, it would be better for each user to have their own salt. But
    while the number of users is small, and the app is not a tempting target,
    keeping salt as a constant common to all is a rational compromise.
