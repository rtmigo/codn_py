# 0.4.0

- Replaced KDF from Scrypt to **Argon2**
- To identify the block, we now try to decrypt and verify its header.
  Previously, two hashes were used for this. It was more difficult to implement,
  less efficient and less reliable
- Random padding is no longer added to the beginning of the block
- Fixed `setup.py` issue with subpackages


# 0.3.0

- Replaced random sized blobs with fixed sized blocks
- The vault file is now indistinguishable from random data  

# 0.2.0

- A binary "vault" file is used instead of a directory. This is more reliable

- Entries and fakes are stored as blobs in the vault file

- Blob sizes are random. The size of the fakes is random. Large entries are
  broken into parts, small entries are padded

- (flaw) The file stores blob sizes openly. It can be easily recognized

# 0.1.0

- All imprints have been moved inside the files

- The file names are now random

- Elements are split into a random number of parts

- Directory now stores random salt

- The directory is indistinguishable from random data

# 0.0.0

- The data is stored in a directory. Imprints are encoded in file names

- Random padding is added to real data files

- Random fake files are generated to hide the number of real ones

- (flaw) It is easy to guess that the directory was generated by the utility:
  filenames have a fixed length
