class Imprint:
    """Each codename key (CK) has a conventionally infinite number of imprints.

    ===

    Different nonce values allow us to generate different imprints for
    the same private key.

    Hashes allow us to identify blocks that are (probably) associated with
    this private key.


    IMPRINT COLLISION
    -----------------

    False imprint matches are possible in the following cases:

    1. KDF failure: KDF produces two identical keys from different codenames.
       For each of the codenames, we get both correct blocks and blocks
       associated with the different codename

    2. Blake2 failure: With the same nonce, but different private keys,
       the blake2 produced the same hash. Among the correct blocks
       there will be one block, in fact, associated with another code name

    3. URandom failure: Two identical nonces are used for the same private
       key (same codename), so we got totally identical imprints for two
       different blocks. Both blocks will be assigned to the correct name
       group, as we expected, so this is not a huge problem

    4. Some of these problems happened at the same time.

    All of these incredible coincidences reveal more data than we planned.
    However, no attacker will exploit this. Even iterating over keys for a
    thousand years is more efficient than waiting in full readiness for a
    random, not very useful collision.

    It is important that the utility does not corrupt the data due to
    a collision.

    (1) and (2) potentially problems. We can assign the block to the wrong name
    group and delete the block by mistake.

    The good news is that an imprint collision will only make us briefly
    think that some block belongs to the current name group (when it isn't).
    Next, we will read the encrypted block header, and then:

    * verify the header with 128-bit blake2s. This proves that the block does
      indeed match the private key. This was not a collision of 256-bit blake2
      hashes (2)

    * read the codename from the header and compare to the codename provided
      by user. This proves that the block does indeed refer to the codename
      and there was no KDF collision (1)

    Both measures complement each other: we see that the private key is
    suitable, that the code name is decrypted correctly, that the codename
    matches the expected.

    This is still not deterministic. But even if you brute force it hard, it
    will lead to a collision only on a spaceship with infinite improbability
    drive. This is also not a completely deterministic statement.
